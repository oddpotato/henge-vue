# henge-vue

Creating a SPA called Henge. It's Hinge, but for druids. Right now this is just a SPA without authentication but hopefully we can add authentication later.

## functionality needed

* Be able to view druids
* Be able to filter druids by custom attributes 
- Currently: beard length, gods worshipped, favourite robe color, favourite ritual
* Be able to contact druids via contact form 
- Contact list preferably lets you know exactly who they were emailing
- Could pass a data property from li
* Be able to register as interested in druids
- This is just front-end right now but should be able to add user accounts behind auth later

# components

* Header
* Footer
* Contact Page
* Contact Form
* Druid list
* Druid

# store

* Druids
* Messages

# API?

After making the basic app it would be nice to migrate from store to an API with data hosted on Firebase
